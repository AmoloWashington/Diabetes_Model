# Diabetes Prediction App

This project is a web application designed to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on various symptoms and risk factors. The application utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze a dataset of diabetes symptoms and provide predictions based on user input.

## Features

- **Data Exploration**: Visualize and understand the diabetes symptoms dataset through exploratory data analysis.
- **Model Training**: Train and evaluate machine learning models for diabetes prediction, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosting.
- **Make Prediction**: Input patient information to receive a diabetes risk assessment.
- **About Diabetes**: Learn about diabetes, its symptoms, risk factors, and prevention strategies.

## Files

- **app.py**: Contains the main application code for the Diabetes Prediction App, including functions for data loading, exploratory data analysis, model building, and making predictions.
- **diabetes_symptoms_data.csv**: A dataset containing information about various diabetes symptoms and their correlation with diabetes diagnosis, used for training the machine learning models and for exploratory data analysis.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the dependencies required to run the application, including libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, Streamlit, and Plotly.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Launch the application using Streamlit with the command `streamlit run app.py`.
4. Navigate through the app to explore the data, train models, and make predictions.
